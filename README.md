## 🧩 What is DaMath 53?

**DaMath 53** is an exciting two-player board game that blends the thrill of strategy with the power of mathematics. Designed to engage players in a battle of wits and numbers, DaMath 53 goes beyond the traditional format by introducing a twist: numbers are no longer just base 10. Get ready to encounter binary, trigonometric expressions, logarithms, and more!

---

## 🎯 Objective

Each player starts with an equal number of chips. The goal is to **capture your opponent's chips** and score points based on:

- The **mathematical value** of the captured chip  
- The **operation** applied to it on the board (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)

The player with the **highest total score** at the end of the game wins.

## ♟️ What's New in DaMath 53?

Unlike the classic DaMath game, DaMath 53 challenges players by introducing **non-decimal number forms** and **advanced mathematical concepts**:

- 🔢 **Binary Numbers** (e.g., `1011₂`)  
- 📐 **Trigonometric Expressions** (e.g., `sin(30°)`, `cos(π/3)`)  
- 📊 **Logarithmic Functions** (e.g., `log₂(8)`, `ln(e)`)  
- 🧠 And **more forms** that challenge your computational thinking!

These formats not only add complexity but also enhance mathematical fluency, especially in converting and computing different expressions on the fly.

---

## 🧮 Educational Benefits

DaMath 53 helps improve:

- Logical and critical thinking  
- Understanding of number systems and mathematical operations  
- Conversion between different numerical forms  
- Real-time mental math and problem-solving skills

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Players take turns moving their chips across the board  
2. If a player captures an opponent's chip, the value of that chip is evaluated based on the board's operation sign  
3. Points are calculated accordingly  
4. The game ends when all opponent chips are captured or no legal moves remain  
5. The player with the **highest total score** is declared the **winner**

---

## 📚 Example

> Player A captures a chip labeled `log₂(8)` on a tile with a `×` sign and multiplies it by `cos(0)`  
>  
> 🧮 **Calculation**: `log₂(8) × cos(0) = 3 × 1 = 3` points

---

## 🧠 Tips for Winning

- Learn to quickly evaluate different mathematical forms  
- Plan your moves strategically based on high-value targets  
- Use operation tiles to your advantage
